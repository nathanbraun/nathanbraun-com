# Patri Friedman's Advice Experience Hierarchy

As someone who likes to give and is receptive to advice, I really like Patri
Friedman's [advice experience hierarchy](https://twitter.com/patrissimo/status/1213925803488006144):

> 1. I heard about this cool idea.
> 2. I read for a few minutes about this cool idea...
> 3. I actually considered trying this cool idea!
> 4. I actually briefly tried this new thing!!
> 5. I did this new thing for weeks or months and it so worked!!!
> 6. I did this thing for years or decades and it's deeply woven into my life.
> 7. I've spoken with / taught a few others how to do the thing.
> 8. I've studied most extant research about this thing & can summarize
> 9. I've spoken to / worked with / interviewed hundreds of people working on this thing (generally as a professional, or through net communities).

Spots 4-5 are the biggest traps. It's very easy to be excited (and tell people
about) an app, productivity technique, lifestyle change etc that you've been
doing for a few weeks or months. It's much harder to consistently and long term
weave it into your life.

I agree with Friedman that usefulness follows a power law up the hierarchy:

> "Advice that has worked for someone long-term is easily 10x or 100x more
> valuable than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And advice based on a large cross-section of
> people is easily 10x or 100x more valuable than one person's experience. -
> Patri Friedman

Since hearing about this, I've tried to move away from handing out advice and
recommendations that are less than 6, or at least adding a caveat if I do
(speaking of, these tweets are only about a year old, so the advice in this
post — stop giving/taking short term advice — isn't more than a 5 for me).

## Personal Level 6+ Habits
Here are a few of the things I've been doing/using for several years, i.e.
they'd be at least a 6 on the advice experience hierarchy.

- [Vim](vim) (probably a 7).
- Reading every night before I fall asleep.
- Chopping up big container of vegetables in advance for each day of the week.
- Lifting weights, playing pickup basketball for cardiovascular exercise in lieu of jogging.

## Examples of Level 9 Advice
Because advice gets scarcer as you move up the hierarchy, I'd also be
interested in collecting examples of type 9 advice.

For example:
- [80,000 Hours Career Guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/)
- People like [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) for building VC backed startups or [Rob Walling](https://robwalling.com/blog/) for the bootstrapped small scale versions.

Stay tuned for more.
