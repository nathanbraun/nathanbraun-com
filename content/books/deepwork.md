# Notes on Deep Work

## Definitions
Deep work: professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free
concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit, create new
value, improve your skill, hard to replicate

As opposed to shallow work: non-cognitively demanding, logistic style tasks, often
performed while distracted, low value and easy to replicate.

Most workers (esp knowledge workers) do a ton of shallow work.

There is a massive opportunity for people who prioritize depth.

## Part 1: Motivation
The first section of the book is Newport making the case that deep work is
valuable, rare, and meaningful.
  
### Valuable
It's essential to (1) learn new, hard skills quickly and (2) perform at a high
level (both in terms of speed, quality) both involve pushing skills and
capabilities to their limits.
  
Newport also talks about biological/neurological mechanisms for why
learning/working while distracted is less effective

### Rare
Newport basically needs this chapter so people can't say, "if deep work is so
valuable, why don't more people do it?"

His answer: (1) metric black hole (hard for businesses to measure who, what is
really productive) and (2) path of least resistance (running day out of inbox,
sitting on skype just easier) another reason: culturally, people view tech as
being worth it if it provides ANY benefit (regardless of costs).

For example: "I read that really cool thing on twitter once" vs the usual where
you wasted  a bunch of time/were distracted.

> "Principle of least resistance + metric black hole = work cultures that save
> us from short term discomfort of concentration and planning at the expense of
> long-term satisfaction and creation of real value." - Newport

### Meaningful
Happiness researchers: "best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind
is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something
difficult and worthwhile."

Most people underestimate happiness at work, overestimate happiness relaxing.

Much of shallow work is trivial, annoying, stressful <- not deep working means
this is at the forefront of your attention much of the time.

## Part 2: Practice
The 2nd part of the book is HOW to do more/better deep work necessary because
deep work isn't just something that'll happen because you want it to, you need
systems, routines, habits, etc.

He supports with examples from historical, known deep workers, lessons drawn.

Bottom line basically: don't be haphazard in work habits don't wait for
inspiration.

In talking about how to do deep work Newport zooms in and out of different
levels over different chapters.

Generally, I'd divide the advice up as:

High level: identify what you're deep working towards, track deep work, do
weekly reviews.


Lower or medium level, e.g.:
- plan out every minute of your day
- be done working at a certain time
- say no/minimize shallow obligations

Separately, Newport puts a big emphasis on -- even when not (deep) working --
not giving in to mindless phone/internet/distraction

### High Level.
Newport goes through some business literature talking about HOW people achieve
goals.

1. identify small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with deep work hours
2. act on lead measures (time spent in a state of deep work dedicated towards ambitious outcomes)
3. keep a compelling scoreboard (e.g. tally of hours deep worked per week in office)
4. create a cadence of accountability

For (4), Newport did weekly reviews, where he look over scoreboard and
celebrate good weeks, understand what led to bad weeks, figure out how to
ensure good scores in days ahead

### Lower/Medium Level Planning Daily Planning
Most people spend more time on shallow work then they realize.

To combat: plan every minute of your day in 30 minute increments.

Cal newport does his daily planning either: (1) night before, (2) first thing
in the morning, (3) after he knocks out a big task in the morning.

Don't just plan work, plan lunch, relaxation too.

#### Flexiblity
Planning doesn't mean you can't be flexible, if you get interrupted or things
take longer just replan remainder of day when you need to.

The goal isn't to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it's instead to
maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you're doing with your time
going forward -- even if those decisions are reworked again and again as the
day unfolds.

Can plan "task blocks", where just knock out smaller, specific things you have
to do.

Newport has a rule for himself: if stumbles upon a really important insight, OK
to spend rest of day thinking about it.
 
Most people use a plan as wishful thinking at first (definitely true in my
experience), but should try to be accurate/conservative.

#### Weekly Planning
Note: not a lot of stuff on weekly planning in Newport's book, instead some of
these notes are from posts on his blog.
usually spends 1+ hour planning week

Be flexible, can do goals for each day or broader heuristics ("need to spend 3
hours each day on...").

Big part of weekly planning process if working back from calendar to fill open
time effectively.

#### Full Horizon Planning
Same as above about not in Deep Work, found on blog.

Newport views work in terms of projects. Each project has two states: dormant
or active.

If it's dormant, tracked somewhere that he regularly reviews (so he won't
forget about it).

If it's active, he makes a plan for how and when the whole thing will be
completed.

> "To pull this off, this plan must exist at multiple levels of refining
> granularity. That is, on the monthly level, I know what weeks I will work on
> the project, and only when I get to those weeks do I plan out what days I
> will work on it, and only when I get to the specific days do I figure out
> which hours it will consume."

> "These plans, of course, change as things unfold, but the point is that I
> donâ€™t deal in abstractions, I like to work directly with the brute
> physicality of time. This makes sure I get the most out of the cycles I have
> available, and it prevents me from committing to more than is feasible."

#### Be done by 5:30
Newport calls this "fixed-schedule productivity"

Works backward to fit all he needs to get done in his time allocated for
working. He thinks it makes him more productive.

> "Because my time is limited each day, I cannot afford to allow a large
> deadline to creep up on me, or a morning to be wasted on something trivial,
> because I didn't take a moment to craft a smart plan."

Includes some non-work benefits:
- more present with family
- reads more books
- more comfortable being bored

#### Eliminate shallow obligations
You should get comfortable saying no to things. No should be the default.

> "The bar for gaining access to your attention and time should be very high."

#### Email
Do more work when sending/responding.

It's tempting to do quickest thing to get it out of your inbox, but wastes time
in the long run. Instead think about "project" the email represents, what the
desired state of that project is and how to get there, then in your response
make clear where you are currently/how to get there.

Get comfortable not responding. Don't respond if:
- it's not something that interests you
- nothing really good/bad would happen if you did/didn't respond

#### Distraction
Obviously distraction during work is bad, it's one of definitions of shallow
work.

But even when you're not working, will be much better off if can wean self from
dependence on distraction

> "Same way athletes take care of bodies outside just training, you'll struggle
> to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your
> time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom" 

I.e. don't just give in and mindlessly surf when you're waiting in line, etc
need to be comfortable being bored.

This will help you work even deeper when you are doing it

Instead of being always online, on phone etc, with occasional breaks to focus,
do the reverse: always off, with scheduled times to give into distraction if
you actually need to use the internet a lot, just schedule more time for it

This isn't in deep work, but this helped me re phone (basically solved me
feeling like I spend too much time on my phone, wish every problem I had was
this easy to solve):
