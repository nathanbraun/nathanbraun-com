# The Three Languages of Politics
One of the simplest, most illuminating books I've ever read is Arnold Kling's
[The Three Languages of Politics](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Languages-Politics-Talking-Political-dp-1948647427/dp/1948647427/ref=dp_ob_title_bk).

Kling's idea: conservatives, liberals and libertarians *communicate* (more on
whether it's just communicate or something else later) about political issues
on three, separate axes:
- progressives on the *oppressed* vs *oppressor* axis
- conservatives on the *civilization* vs *barbarism* axis
- libertarians in terms of *freedom* vs *coercion*

Once you notice this framework, it becomes a lot easier to understand other's
views on almost any issue.

Many issues span all three axes. Illegal immigration is typical example.

## Illegal Immigration
**Progressives** view immigrants as oppressed by unjust immigration laws, border
patrol agents, ICE, etc. They're more likely to pay attention to kids in cages
or stories about fully assimilated DREAMERs excelling in school at risk of
being deported.

**Conservatives** argue that immigrants (particularly illegal, but legal too) have
negative cultural impacts on "civilization" (western/market
oriented/traditional values) at the margin.

They also tend to focus on the fact that (by definition) illegal immigration is
against the law. They often focus on rates of criminality by immigrants (and
specific anecdotes), as well as anecdotes about immigrants advocating things
like Sharia law.

**Libertarians** believe people should have the freedom to live, work and
enter whatever mutually beneficial work arrangement they want. They are
against immigration laws that prohibit this.

They'd pay more attention to stories of hardworking immigrations who came up
from nothing (conservatives also appreciate this narrative) who are driving an
Uber to earn money to send back to their families.

## Other Examples
Other examples of issues that pretty clearly span all three axes (see if you
can mentally make the argument for each axis):

- drug laws
- abortion
- soda taxes
- whether wedding cake bakers can discriminate against gay couples

(The last two come directly from Kling's book).

If I were a middle or high school civics teacher, I'd make students analyze
issues in terms of the axes all day long.

## Some issues are fights between two axes
Many issues have three distinct axes based arguments. But often an issue (or
a fight about them) will be between two of the three camps. Take Columbus day.

**Progressives** view Columbus as an invader, who oppressed, killed and cheated
native American peoples.

**Conservatives** view Columbus day as something America has *always*
[celebrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition) and
— while not exactly denying that Columbus did some bad things — was a sort of
symbolic tipping point to modern America, civilization, progress, etc.

This particular issue doesn't seem to fit that well on the **libertarian** axis.
Maybe libertarians are against state holidays generally?

## Axes aren't always equal
On some issues, a dominant axis may emerge, where most people find themselves
on a certain axis, even if they don't usually frame issues this way.

For example, most people today view 1960s civil rights struggle in US on the
oppressor-oppressed dimension. This clearly wasn't the case at the time; many
people then thought individual businesses and people should have the *freedom*
to discriminate if they want.

While some people still advocate this, they're pretty hardcore on the
freedom-coercion axis. Most people in US today view the issue through that
lens, and take a favorable view of civil rights.

Other examples: initially, I think most people viewed both 9/11 and the
Charlie Hebdo shootings in civilization-barbarism terms (though apparently
many on the left have recently been accusing Charlie Hebdo of
[racism](https://nyti.ms/3rb1uc), so maybe not).

## Extensions and Open Questions
Having though about the three axis model for a while and gotten in the habit
of viewing contentious issues through the various lenses, here are some
miscellaneous thoughts and open questions.

### 1. It's not that people are just on different axes, they often take issue with the "good" ends of other axes
Each axis has its good end, i.e. freedom, civilization, non-oppression (OK
fine, it's debatable whether the progressive axis has a "good" end or whether
they're just anti-oppression).

To me, it seems like thinking primarily on an axis means you tend to discount
whether the good end of the other axes are worth pursuing. I think helps
explain certain behavior, and makes the model even more useful.

For example, **conservatives care about civilization**.

Do progressives? It's debatable. It's especially obvious with the
environmental movement and the left's romanticized views on pre-colonial,
indigenous societies. Also see how progressives tended to end up pro Covid
lockdown (many pointing out they're reducing carbon emissions).

Do libertarians? Maybe but not always. For example, many libertarians argue
immigrants should be let in on principle, even if it puts some of the
freedom/market aspects of western culture at risk

**Libertarians care about freedom.**

Do progressives? There is obvious
[historical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism)
[evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) to the contrary.
But even at the margin, are progressives in favor of people being free to spend
their money (or hire, or eat, or wear) on what they want, or less?

Do conservatives? Again, sort of, but in many ways no. See the NSA, Patriot
Act, Snowden as traitor, drug war, historical opposition to gay marriage, etc.

**Progressives care about stopping oppression.**

Do conservatives?

While no one would categorize themselves as pro-oppression, my reading is
conservatives take issue with much that is categorized as oppression today. For
example, many are fond of pointing out that when you control for violent crime
rates, it doesn't appear minorities are systematically more likely to be shot
by police than whites.

I think libertarians would generally agree (though in that specific example
libertarians would say police in general are way too militarized and
powerful). They also have more a of a freedom bent, and are hesitant to call
anything the result of voluntary transactions oppression. "yeah, working in
a sweat shop would suck, but these workers technically have a choice".

### 2. Is this just the way people communicate, or is it something more?
Kling is careful to say he's talking about *communicating* about political
issues. That's why the book is called the three *languages* of politics.

> "Let me quickly add that I do *not* believe that the three-axes model serves
> to explain or describe the different political ideologies. I am not trying to
> say that political beliefs are caused by one's choice of axis. Nor am I
> saying that people think exclusively in terms of their preferred axis.

I'm not sure that goes far enough, though it's obviously noisy. But I would
expect, for example, that people who identify with the freedom-coercion axis
generally favor smaller government, fewer regulations etc.

### 3. How much do these axes bleed into each other?
When you stare at them for a while, the boundaries between axes gets a bit
fuzzy.
- *oppression* is arguably another word for infringing on someones *liberty*
- many progressives frame their oppression arguments in terms of "positive liberty", e.g. if a sweatshop worker or a poor kid in the ghetto doesn't have good options, they're not technically free.
- one of the foundational concepts of western civilization is freedom (life, liberty, pursuit of happiness) and equality under the law

To the extent there is overlap, what should we do about it?

Probably just not think about it too hard. It's a model, not necessarily
exactly the way the world works in granular detail.

### 4. Is there another axis?
In a follow up edition, Kling toyed with adding what he called a bobo/anti
bobo axis.

Bobo is an idea from the NYT columnist David Brooks, and (in my understanding)
is basically the cosmopolitan/elite/smug/believe science vs the
backlash/anti-smug/troll/the CDC originally said not to wear masks axis.

In particular, the phenomena of Trump, who — while he definitely has
conservative themes like law and order, isn't exactly the epitome of western
civilization either — makes this axis intriguing.

### 5. On average, are members of some groups at more "extreme" ends of their axis than others?

Here I'm mostly thinking of progressives, which seems to have taken the
oppression/non-oppression axis so far in one direction (particularly when it
comes to racial, sexual and gender identities) that it always reminds me
(perhaps weirdly) of *allergies*.

Allergies are caused by your body's immune system reacting too strongly to
things that are really not that big of a deal. In the same way, my impression
is that the left's hyper sensitivity to any sort of identity-based oppression
is causing some real dysfunction, both within the left itself and in society at
large.

### 6. Many of the ideological fault lines seem to be about nature vs nurture, how does this fit in?

My guess: this is mostly relevant in impacting how people view the extent of
oppression.

For example: take the underrepresentation of women in tech. If everyone is
a [Blank
Slate](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000QCTNIM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),
this disparity could very well be due to oppression.

But if — on *average* (individuals are of course all over the place, which is
good!) — women are less inclined to study tech related fields for some nature
related reason (whether it's the things/people dynamic or because on average
[girls are better at
reading](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/09/girls-comparative-advantage-in-reading-can-largely-explain-the-gender-gap-in-math-related-fields.html),
whatever) than this disparity might be just something that happens, no
oppression necessary.

Note: even if true, this doesn't at all mean women can't like tech or are
"weird" or less feminine if they do, any more than men who [like to
read](https://goodreads.com/nathanbraun). Again, differences *within* groups
swamp differences *between* groups. It also doesn't rule out any oppression
whatsoever.

### 7. How does this theory fit with with Bryan Caplan's simplistic model of left and right?

Caplan (possibly somewhat tongue in cheek) [theory](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/10/my_simplistic_t.html):
the left hates markets, the right hates the left.

### 8. Where do conspiracy theories fit?

Are certain groups (OK, conservatives) more inclined to buy into conspiracy
theories? If so, why?

### 9. Do people's cobbled-together, irrational, self-justifying minds make thinking about axes less useful?

E.g. see the GOP House Freedom Caucus, which starting in 2016 did a massive shift away from Freedom/towards Trumpism. To the extent this sort of thing happens (both at the individual and group level), the model seems less useful.
