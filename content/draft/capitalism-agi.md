One reason I'm skeptical about AI doom because we're already living among
massively powerful "non-aligned" systems. 

Two examples:
- evolution, i.e. the system by which genetic material makes copies of itself
- the system of capitalism/markets/profit and loss, i.e. a ruthlessly efficient
  engine for transporting resources (and labor) from lower to higher values.

Both, like the super AGI that doomers fear:
- are impossible to stop and extremely difficult to reliably control.
- have had planet wide effects.
- have created physical breakthroughs in nanotechnology (e.g. eukaryotic cells,
  spider webs, Dupont, Monsanto).
- are further advancing (A)I.

Yes, it's likely neither are conscious, but conciousness is overrated. A
significantly powerful paperclip maximizer, the argument goes, could wipe out
humanity, conscious or not.

Plus, unlike AI, these systems are actually doing all these things, not just
hypothetically doing them.

## What about alignment?
It's hard to argue evolution is humanity (or any species) aligned, given 99%+
of all species that have ever lived are now extinct (although you [gotta hand
it](https://twitter.com/dril/status/831805955402776576?lang=en) to evolution
for having created humans in the first place).

Capitalism is trickier, I'd describe it as pseudo-aligned. When Michael Munger
say resources move from "lower to higher values" above he's talking about what
humans value, i.e. in the marketplace. And humans value existing. That said,
it's not perfect and there are some interesting sub-phenomena.

For one, some people desire destruction/crime/fraud etc. And the market
certainly accommodates that. But, as David Friedman points out, resources are
usually more valuable to original owners than thieves, which is means there are
markets in security too.

More interesting is the idea humans don't always value what's good for them.
Capitalism is pretty good at accommodating that too. For example, capturing
attention and wrecking teenagers mental health via dopamine hits + [variable
reward schedules](https://www.benkuhn.net/skinner/) in order to sell ads. Or
selling outrage and partisanship (Fox News, CNN) ... also in order to sell ads.

## Why this hurts the doomer argument
Powerful forces beyond humans capabilities and control are clearly not
unprecedented; we're living among several. This doesn't mean a powerful AI
couldn't be dangerous, of course, but sometimes I'll see someone say, "An AI
will be 1000x smarter and faster thinking than the smartest human. It doesn't
matter what it's goals are. If they're not aligned with ours we're toast."

The fact we're living among a resource moving engine incomprehensible + orders
of magnitude more powerful than smartest human shows that's not true. 

It also makes me skeptical that this might be the "[most important
century](https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/)". I'd be more
inclined to give that to the Industrial Revolution.

Overall, I also think it lowers the probability of "foom", which is the idea
that one AI can/will quickly become more powerful than all humans and
everything else on the planet combined. This result follows if AGI doomers are
overlooking existing powerful systems.

More generally, I think this demonstrates a blind spot. People such as Elizer
Yudkowsy are generally smart individuals. This good, but also gives them a
tendancy to overrate concious intelligence. As a result they imagine something
1000x as smart as they are now as being literally most powerful thing in the
universe. But the point here is capitalism/evolution/other emergent phenomena
are very powerful (if not "smart") in ways much different from just cranking an
IQ dial up.

Another interesting angle: because capitalism is at least pseudo-aligned, any
potential malevolent AI will have to go through it to hurt humans. The means
the hypothetical future AI vs human battle isn't like chess, where stockfish
can just annihilate any human. Instead it's AI vs this super powerful resource
engine working roughly on behalf of humans.

(Counterpoint: admittedly, if we *do* get a dangerous AI, it'll be because by
this engine.)

(Counter-counterpoint: it's also only reason we're here -- there's no way earth
could support 8B humans without functioning markets and the technology they
incentivized.)

I think these are good examples of powerful, not purely aligned systems with
goals (spend as much time as possible on our website, keep tuning into our TV
show) that have mostly worked. Just walk into any type of waiting room anywhere
and see how many people are on their phones. That said, it's technically want
people want.

(e.g. as a by product of energy needs, which it satisfies — not just from the
sun or other organisms — but from tapping the energy 100M year old fossils
collected from the sun. This might be the biggest breakthrough in energy since
phagocytosis)
