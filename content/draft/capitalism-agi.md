One reason I'm skeptical about AI doom because it seems to me like we're
already living among massively powerful "non-aligned" systems. 

One example: capitalism/markets/the profit and loss system, which is a
relentless and ruthlessly efficient engine for transporting resources (and
labor) from lower to higher values.

Think about it. Like the super AGI that doomers fear it's:
- extremely difficult to reliably control; impossible to stop
- having unintended, planet wide effects (e.g. as a by product of energy needs,
  which it satisfies — not just from the sun or other organisms — but from
  tapping the energy 100M year old fossils collected from the sun. This might
  be the biggest breakthrough in energy since phagocytosis)
- involved in nanotechnology (e.g. Dupont was founded in 1802, Monsanto in
  1902, TSM in 1987)
- advancing AI 

(Interestingly, if you remove the "artificial" from *artificial intelligence*,
evolution is another system that checks all these boxes too.)

Yeah, capitalism probably isn't conscious, but conciousness is overrated. A
significantly powerful paperclip maximizer, the argument goes, could wipe out
humanity, conscious or not.

## Is capitalism aligned?
I'd describe it as pseudo-aligned. When Michael Munger say resources move from
"lower to higher values" in the quote above he's talking about what humans
value, i.e. in the marketplace. And humans value existing. That said, it's not
perfect, and there are some interesting sub-phenomena.

For one, some people desire destruction/crime/fraud etc and the market
accommodates. But, as David Friedman points out, resources are usually more
valuable to the original owner than the thief, and humans value security too.

More interesting is the idea humans don't always value what's good for them.
Capitalism is pretty good at accommodating that too. For example, capturing
attention and wrecking teenagers mental health via dopamine hits + [variable
reward schedules](https://www.benkuhn.net/skinner/) in order to sell ads. Or
selling outrage and partisanship (Fox News, CNN) ... also in order to sell ads.

## Why this hurts the doomer argument
- powerful forces beyond humans control are clearly not unprecedented
  - talking about capitalism here, but culture/status, science, and
    domestic/global politics could be others
    - note: other forces not nec benign either: global politics (with science,
      capitalism) behind prob biggest humanity wide threat in nuclear weapons
  - hurts the "most important century" argument i think
  - if missed this, what else have they missed
- because capitalism is at least pseudo-aligned, any potential malevolent AI
  will have to go through it to hurt humans
  - it's hypothetical future AI vs human battle isn't like chess, where
    stockfish can annihilate any humans, it's AI vs super powerful resource
    engine working roughly on behalf of humans
    - counterpoint: admittedly, if we do get a dangerous AI, it'll be because
      by this engine
      - counter-counterpoint: it's also only reason we're here -- there's no
        way earth could support 8B humans without functioning markets and the
        technology they incentivized.
