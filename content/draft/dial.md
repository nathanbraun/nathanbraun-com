# There is no giant society dial

One of my all time favorite articles is [The Reality of Markets](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2005/Robertsmarkets.html) by Russ Roberts.

In it Russ describes two types of phenomena:
- things you have no control over, e.g. the weather
- things you *do* have control over, e.g. your thermostat 

But, as Russ says:

> ... there is a third category of experienceâ€”phenomena that are the product of
> human action but not of human design.

He goes on to give some examples, like language.

> Because no one is in charge, we might expect language to be chaotic and
> random. But words donâ€™t fall like rain. ... Language emerges from the complex
> interaction of those who speak, read and write it.

Or traffic:

> Why does it take so long to get around during rush hour? Whose fault is that?
> No oneâ€™s. But itâ€™s not a random or a natural phenomenon. Traffic is the
> result of human activity but not the result of human design.

Or prices:

> ...if you move from St. Louis to Washington D.C. as I did two years ago,
> youâ€™ll find that a house in Washington D.C. is more expensive than a
> comparable house in St. Louis. When I bought my house in Washington, I wasnâ€™t
> angry at the seller for charging such a high price. ... *Most people
> understand that the price of a house isnâ€™t really set in any real sense by
> the seller or by any one person or by any collective will.*

So does that mean we have no control over these phenomena? Not quite:

> This doesnâ€™t mean there arenâ€™t ways to affect commuting time or emergent
> phenomena. Traffic congestion isnâ€™t like the rain. **But the obvious ways,
> the ways that are akin to turning a dial donâ€™t work the way people
> anticipate.** Widening the freeways and adding public transit options fail to
> reduce rush hour traffic for anything other than the very short term.
>
> **These "solutions" treat the outcomes of an emergent process as if they were
> the temperature on the thermostat.**

Russ is absolutely correct here, and the way he words this is why it's one of
my favorite essays. The only part I might disagree with is whether people do
actually understand this, but that's nitpicking.

I 100% agree with Russ that humans have a tendancy to view emergent phenomena
through the turn-the-dial-on-the-thermostat lens.

> Understanding the emergent phenomena economists call a market is the essence
> of the economic way of thinking. In contrast, the human brain seems more
> accustomed to what might be called the engineering way of thinking where
> human action and human design work together.
> 
> If Iâ€™m dissatisfied with the size of my kitchen, I make a plan and by
> following the plan, if itâ€™s a good plan, the result is a bigger kitchen. A
> person who sits around hoping for a new kitchen without design or action is
> going to be disappointed. Or if I notice the leaves falling from the trees, I
> donâ€™t hope that theyâ€™re going to clean themselves up. I have to plan to rake
> them and then do the actual raking.

- russ roberts idea of society as a giant dial
  - vs emergent sytem
  - think because it involves humans, something they can control
  - a lot of people think this way, prob natural tendency
  - EAs also do (Holden, AI is important, working on it)

  - implications of not a dial: what's the difference between humans and e.g.
    ants or trees
