# Experiment Backlog

Over at the members forum of [commoncog.com](https://commoncog.com) there's a
weekly thread where everyone posts the various productivity or personal growth
experiments they're working on and follows up later with the results.

As part of that, I started keeping an experiment backlog of things to try at
some point, and thought it might be useful to post it here.

Some of these would work on a week timescale, others would be longer.

### **1. Read 5 books on a single topic**

[Slava Akhmechet recommended this](https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-i-read) in a
substack post and said it's how he reads.

> "A single book is a pinhole view of the world set up by the author. You have
> no input into its contents, and therefore cannot change the orientation of
> this view. But you do choose the books you select. That means you can stitch
> together multiple pinhole views into a unique lens to examine the world— one
> that no one else will have unless they use the same list of books to stitch
> together the same lens." — Slava Akhmechet

*In progress.* I'm in the middle of this one currently. My experimental topic
is Singapore. I'm on book two of LKY's [autobiography](https://www.amazon.com/Third-World-First-Singapore-1965-2000/dp/0060197765). After that I'll read [Liberalism Disavowed](https://www.amazon.com/Liberalism-Disavowed-Communitarianism-Capitalism-Singapore/dp/1501713442) and then 2-3 of:

- [Policy Innovations for Affordable Housing In Singapore](https://www.amazon.com/Policy-Innovations-Affordable-Housing-Singapore/dp/3319753487)
- [Authoritarian Rule of Law](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00866GYDW/ref=x_gr_w_glide_sin?caller=Goodreads&callerLink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F13832316-authoritarian-rule-of-law&tag=x_gr_w_glide_sin-20)
- [Myth or Magic: the Singapore Health Care System](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18401211-myth-or-magic---the-singapore-healthcare-system)

### 2. Try Hemingway's advice to stop working when you know what you're doing next
I came across this in a [writeup by Tyler
Tringas](https://medium.com/personal-growth/hemingway-on-coding-3cffc43c61e).
Apparently, Hemingway gave this advice to an aspiring writer.

> "The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know
> what will happen next. If you do that every day when you are writing a novel
> you will never be stuck. That is the most valuable thing I can tell you so
> try to remember it." — Earnest Hemingway

*Experiment:* at the end of an extended work session on a project, make sure I'll
know what I'll do next. If it's Hemingway's most valuable advice it's worth
trying.

### 3. Spend regular time in nature
The other day we had some people working on our house and me and the dog had to
be out for a few hours. Normally I'd have played golf or something, but
including Charlie restricted my options.

We ended up going to a park and sitting on a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan
for a few hours, which was peaceful/relaxing enough that I could see benefits
to doing it on a regular basis.

*Experiment:* spend at least one hour a week alone (or with Charlie) in nature. 

*Variations:* try reading, doing nothing, writing without an internet
connection, etc.

## Past Experiments
### Go for a quick run in the woods after dropping kids off at school
Initially tried this to see how I liked it. Turned out to be quite a lot, and
now I do it most days it isn't raining.
