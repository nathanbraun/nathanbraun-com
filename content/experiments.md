# Experiments

Over at the members forum of [commoncog.com](https://commoncog.com/blog/) there's a
weekly thread where everyone posts the various productivity or personal growth
experiments they're working on and follows up later with the results.

As part of that, I started keeping an experiment backlog of things to try at
some point, and thought it might be useful to post it here.

Some of these would work on a week timescale, others would be longer.

## Backlog
### 1. Do a blub study
Ben Kuhn wrote a [good essay about these ](https://www.benkuhn.net/blub/).

> effectiveness as an engineer." - Ben Kuhn

### 2. Try the Feynman technique
Came across this in an [article by Scott Young](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2012/10/26/mastering-linear-algebra-in-10-days-astounding-experiments-in-ultra-learning/) on Cal Newport's blog.

Could also combine (1) and (2) and do the Feynman technique on a blub studies topic.

### 3. Try Hemingway's advice to always know what's next
I came across this in a [writeup by Tyler
Tringas](https://medium.com/personal-growth/hemingway-on-coding-3cffc43c61e).
Hemingway:

> "The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know
> what will happen next. If you do that every day when you are writing a novel
> you will never be stuck. That is the most valuable thing I can tell you so
> try to remember it."

This would be more of a true experiment (i.e. as opposed to an aspiration).
Doesn't seem like it'd make *that* big of a difference but if it's Hemingway's
most valuable advice might be worth trying.

### 4. Spend regular time in nature
The other day we had some people working on our house and me and the dog had to
be out for a few hours. Normally I'd have played golf or something, but Charlie tagging along restricted my options.

We ended up going to a park and sitting on a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan.
This was peaceful/relaxing enough that I could see benefits to doing it on a
regular basis.

*Experiment:* spend at least one hour a week alone (or with Charlie) in nature. 

*Variations:* try reading, doing nothing, writing without an internet
gnf
connection, listening to music.

## In Progress
### **Read 5 books on a single topic**

[Slava Akhmechet recommended this](https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-i-read) in a
substack post and said it's how he reads.

> together the same lens." — Slava Akhmechet

I'm in the middle of this one at the moment. My experimental topic
is Singapore. I'm on book two of LKY's [autobiography](https://www.amazon.com/Third-World-First-Singapore-1965-2000/dp/0060197765). After that I'll read [Liberalism Disavowed](https://www.amazon.com/Liberalism-Disavowed-Communitarianism-Capitalism-Singapore/dp/1501713442) and then 2-3 of:

- [Policy Innovations for Affordable Housing In Singapore](https://www.amazon.com/Policy-Innovations-Affordable-Housing-Singapore/dp/3319753487)
- [Authoritarian Rule of Law](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00866GYDW/ref=x_gr_w_glide_sin?caller=Goodreads&callerLink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F13832316-authoritarian-rule-of-law&tag=x_gr_w_glide_sin-20)
- [Myth or Magic: the Singapore Health Care System](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18401211-myth-or-magic---the-singapore-healthcare-system)
### Run with a weighted vest
Started doing this regularly recently.

## Past Experiments
### Run immediately after dropping kids off at school
Initially tried this to see how I liked it. Turned out to be quite a lot, and
now I do it most days weather cooperates.
### Start the day off with 4-6 Pomodoros
### Plan each day out the night before
