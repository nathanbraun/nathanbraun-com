# HPMOR Highlights

Here are a list of the passages I highlighted in a recent rereading of Harry
Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Each highlight includes % through the
book.

> You couldn’t change history. But you could get it right to start with. Do
something differently the first time around...
> 
> Twenty years later, that was what he would desperately wish had happened twenty
years ago, and twenty years before twenty years later happened to be right now.
Altering the distant past was easy, you just had to think of it at the right
time. (8.02%)

> The power comes from knowing the shape of reality and so gaining control over
it. What you understand, you can command, and that is power enough to walk upon
the Moon. The price of that power is that you must learn to ask questions of
Nature, and far more difficult, accept Nature’s answers. You will do
experiments, perform tests and see what happens. And you must accept the
meaning of those results when they tell you that you are mistaken. You will
have to learn how to lose, not to me, but to Nature. When you find yourself
arguing with reality, you will have to let reality win. You will find this
painful, Draco Malfoy, and I do not know if you are strong in that way.

> For a moment there was a very evil grin on the faces of Fred and George.
Then they turned serious. “But Harry, we don’t really know how to do anything
like that -”
> 
> “So figure it out,” Harry said. “I have confidence in you. Not total
confidence, but if you can’t do it, tell me that, and I’ll try someone else, or
do it myself. If you have a really good idea - for both the ridiculous story,
and how to convince Rita Skeeter and her editors to print it - then you can go
ahead and do it. But don’t go with something mediocre. If you can’t come up
with something awesome, just say so.” (22.01%)


> And then Harry began to explain how you went about thinking of things.
It had been known to take longer than two seconds, said Harry.  You never
called any question impossible, said Harry, until you had taken an actual clock
and thought about it for five minutes, by the motion of the minute hand. Not
five minutes metaphorically, five minutes by a physical clock. (22.03%)


> And furthermore, Harry said, his voice emphatic and his right hand thumping
hard on the floor, you did not start out immediately looking for solutions. (22.04%)


> Harry leaned back wearily in the small folding chair that sat at the bottom of
his trunk’s cavern. “You know, Draco, just as the fundamental question of
rationality is ‘What do I think I know and how do I think I know it?’, there’s
also a cardinal sin, a way of thinking that’s the opposite of that. Like the
ancient Greek philosophers. They had no clue what was going on, so they’d go
around saying things like ‘All is water’ or ‘All is fire’, and they never asked
themselves, ’Wait a minute, even if everything is water, how could I possibly
know that?’ They didn’t ask themselves if they had evidence which discriminated
that possibility from all the other possibilities you could imagine, evidence
they’d be very unlikely to encounter if the theory wasn’t true -“ (32.71%)


> "What would you do with eternity, Harry?"
> 
> Harry took a deep breath. “Meet all the interesting people in the world, read
all the good books and then write something even better, celebrate my first
grandchild’s tenth birthday party on the Moon, celebrate my first
great-great-great grandchild’s hundredth birthday party around the Rings of
Saturn, learn the deepest and final rules of Nature, understand the nature of
consciousness, find out why anything exists in the first place, visit other
stars, discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous with everyone for a party on
the other side of the Milky Way once we’ve explored the whole thing, meet up
with everyone else who was born on Old Earth to watch the Sun finally go out,
and I used to worry about finding a way to escape this universe before it ran
out of negentropy but I’m a lot more hopeful now that I’ve discovered the
so-called laws of physics are just optional guidelines.” (33.39%)


> “There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness
> in
the equations of motion. The universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does
not care. The stars don’t care, or the Sun, or the sky. But they don’t have to!
We care! There is light in the world, and it is us! ” (33.93%)


> He’d tried to teach himself to face reality without flinching, and though
> Harry had not yet mastered that art, still those grooves had been worn into his mind, the learned reflex to look toward the painful thought instead of away. (36.67%)


> You had to put up with little nuisances, if you were one of the lucky and
unlucky few to be born on Earth; on Ancient Earth, as it would be remembered
someday. (36.73%)


> This was one of Draco Malfoy’s lessons which Harry had thought was actually
pretty smart: people who tried to defend themselves got questioned over every
little point and could never satisfy their interrogators; but if you made it
clear from the start that you were a celebrity and above social conventions,
people’s minds wouldn’t bother tracking most violations. (39.64%)


> “Look, Hermione… if you worry that much about what other people think, if
you’re unhappy whenever other people don’t picture you exactly the same way you
picture yourself, that’s already dooming yourself to always be unhappy. No one
ever thinks of us just the same way we think of ourselves.” (39.72%)

> What do you think you know, and how do you think you know it? (42.34%)


> You know, said the part of him that refined his skills, didn’t you sort of
ponder, once, how every different profession has a different way to be
excellent, how an excellent teacher isn’t like an excellent plumber; but they
all have in common certain methods of not being stupid; and that one of the
most important such techniques is to face up to your little mistakes before
they turn into BIG mistakes? (50.36%)


> Like, someone is selling you some kind of alternative medicine that doesn’t
work, and any double-blind experimental study will confirm that it doesn’t
work. So if someone wants to go on defending the lie, they’ve got to get you to
disbelieve in the experimental method. Like, the experimental method is just
for merely scientific kinds of medicine, not amazing alternative medicine like
theirs. Or a good and virtuous person should believe as strongly as they can,
no matter what the evidence says. Or truth doesn’t exist and there’s no such
thing as objective reality. A lot of common wisdom like that isn’t just
mistaken, it’s anti-epistemology, it’s systematically wrong. (52.36%)


> Harry understood the weaknesses of Ravenclaws well enough to know that you had
to try answering your own quibbles.  Did some plans call for waiting? Yes, many
plans called for delayed action; but that was not the same as hesitating to
choose. Not delaying because you knew the right moment to do what was
necessary, but delaying because you couldn’t make up your mind - there was no
cunning plan which called for that. (53.06%)


> Did you sometimes need more information to choose? Yes, but that could also
turn into an excuse for delaying; and it would be tempting to delay, when you
were faced with a choice between two painful alternatives, and not choosing
would avoid the mental pain for a time. (53.06%)


> “Most people are afraid, Miss Granger,” said the old wizard. “They live their
whole lives circumscribed by crippling fear that cuts off everything they might
accomplish, everything they might become. Fear of saying or doing the wrong
thing, fear of losing their mere possessions, fear of death, and above all the
fear of what other people will think of them. (54.49%)


> But Father had once told her that the trouble with passing up opportunities was
that it was habit-forming. If you told yourself you were waiting for a better
opportunity next time, why, next time you’d probably tell yourself the same
thing. Father had said that most people spent their whole lives waiting for an
opportunity that was good enough, and then they died. Father had said that
while seizing opportunities would mean that all sorts of things went wrong, it
wasn’t nearly as bad as being a hopeless lump. Father had said that after she
got into the habit of seizing opportunities, then it was time to start being
picky about them. (56.63%)


> When you are older, you will learn that the first and foremost thing which any
ordinary person does is nothing.” (58.28%)

> I take ten Quirrell points from you, and be glad it is not more.”
> 
> Harry stayed calm. Going through Azkaban had recalibrated his scale of
emotional disturbances; and losing a House point, which had formerly rated five
out of ten, now lay somewhere around zero point three. (58.90%)


> “You could call it heroic responsibility, maybe,” Harry Potter said. “Not like
the usual sort. It means that whatever happens, no matter what, it’s always
your fault. Even if you tell Professor McGonagall, she’s not responsible for
what happens, you are. Following the school rules isn’t an excuse, someone else
being in charge isn’t an excuse, even trying your best isn’t an excuse. There
just aren’t any excuses, you’ve got to get the job done no matter what.” (60.95%)


> “There was a Muggle once named Mohandas Gandhi,” Harry said to the floor. “He
thought the government of Muggle Britain shouldn’t rule over his country. And
he refused to fight. He convinced his whole country not to fight. Instead he
told his people to walk up to the British soldiers and let themselves be struck
down, without resisting, and when Britain couldn’t stand doing that any more,
we freed his country. I thought it was a very beautiful thing, when I read
about it, I thought it was something higher than all the wars that anyone had
ever fought with guns or swords. That they’d really done that, and that it had
actually worked.” Harry drew another breath. “Only then I found out that Gandhi
told his people, during World War II, that if the Nazis invaded they should use
nonviolent resistance against them, too. But the Nazis would’ve just shot
everyone in sight. (62.24%)


> “Don’t you see, if evil people are willing to risk violence to get what they
want, and good people always back down because violence is too terrible to
risk, it’s - it’s not a good society to live in, Headmaster! (62.29%)


> Mr. Malfoy is new to the business of having ideas, and so when he has one, he
becomes proud of himself for having it. He has not yet had enough ideas to
unflinchingly discard those that are beautiful in some aspects and impractical
in others; he has not yet acquired confidence in his own ability to think of
better ideas as he requires them. What we are seeing here is not Mr. Malfoy’s
best idea, I fear, but rather his only idea.” (64.03%)


> Conservation laws. They’d been the critical insight in more Muggle discoveries
than Harry could easily count. In Muggle technology you couldn’t raise a
feather one meter off the ground without the power coming from somewhere. If
you looked at molten lava spilling from a volcano and asked where the heat came
from, a physicist would tell you about radioactive heavy metals in the center
of the Earth’s molten core. If you asked where the energy to power the
radioactivity came from, the physicist would point to an era before the Earth
had formed, and a primordial supernova in the early days of the galaxy which
had baked atomic nuclei heavier than the natural limit, the supernova
compressing protons and neutrons into a tight unstable package that yielded
back some of the supernova’s energy when it split. A light bulb was fueled by
electricity, fueled by a nuclear power plant, fueled by a supernova… You could
play the game all the way back to the Big Bang. (64.52%)


> When Harry was nine years old the IRA had blown up a British barracks, and he’d
watched on TV as all the politicians contested to see who could be the most
loudly outraged. And the thought had occurred to Harry - even then, before he’d
known much about psychology - that it looked like everyone was competing to see
who could be most angry, and nobody would’ve been allowed to suggest that
anyone was being too angry, even if they’d just proposed the saturation nuclear
bombing of Ireland. He’d been struck, even then, by an essential emptiness in
the indignation of politicians - though he hadn’t had the words to describe it,
at that age - a sense that they were trying to score cheap points by hitting at
the same safe target as everyone else. (67.38%)


> Afraid to find out was a warning sign, according to Harry Potter and his
books... (70.51%)


> Like the difference between a student who sits in class because that’s what
students do, versus a student who cares enough to ask themselves what it takes
to actually learn a piece of material, and practices however necessary - you
see, Professor McGonagall? (74.03%)


> In a moral dilemma where you lost something either way, making the choice would
feel bad either way, so you could temporarily save yourself a little mental
pain by refusing to decide. At the cost of not being able to plan anything in
advance, and at the cost of incurring a huge bias toward inaction or waiting
until too late… (75.04%)


> There were parts of Harry’s borrowed books about that, how even people who were
paralyzed in car accidents weren’t nearly as unhappy as they’d expected to be,
six months later, just like lottery winners weren’t nearly as happy as they’d
expected. People adjusted, their happiness levels went back to their happiness
set point, life went on. (75.48%)


> “Look… part of the trick of doing the impossible is being selective about which
impossibilities you challenge, and only trying when you have a special
advantage. (75.78%)


> “Hermione,” Harry said seriously, as he started to dig down into the red-velvet
pouch again, “don’t punish yourself when a bright idea doesn’t work out. You’ve
got to go through a lot of flawed ideas to find one that might work. And if you
send your brain negative feedback by frowning when you think of a flawed idea,
instead of realizing that idea-suggesting is good behavior by your brain to be
encouraged, pretty soon you won’t think of any ideas at all.” Harry put down
two heart-shaped chocolates beside the book. “Here, have another chocolate. (75.83%)



> “Do you think you’re, you’re just genetically better than everyone who lived
back then? Like if you’d been transported back to fifteenth-century London as a
baby, you’d realize all on your own that burning cats was wrong, witch-burning
was wrong, slavery was wrong, that every sentient being ought to be in your
circle of concern? (76.13%)


> Harry recognized an instance of the fear-of-embarrassment schema that stopped
most people from ever doing anything under conditions of uncertainty, and
squashed it down hard. (76.83%)


> “When you do a fault analysis, there’s no point in assigning fault to a part of
the system you can’t change afterward, it’s like stepping off a cliff and
blaming gravity. Gravity isn’t going to change next time. There’s no point in
trying to allocate responsibility to people who aren’t going to alter their
actions. Once you look at it from that perspective, you realize that allocating
blame never helps anything unless you blame yourself, because you’re the only
one whose actions you can change by putting blame there. (78.04%)


> But normal people don’t choose on the basis of consequences, they just play
roles. There’s a picture in your head of a stern disciplinarian and you do
whatever that picture would do, whether or not it makes any sense. A stern
disciplinarian would order the students back to their rooms, even if there was
a troll roaming the hallways. A stern disciplinarian would order students not
to leave the Hall on pain of expulsion. And the little picture of Professor
McGonagall that you have in your head can’t learn from experience or change
herself, so there isn’t any point to this conversation. (78.10%)


> It is possible that you have already done everything you can. Yet I find this a
very rare event indeed, and more often said than done. I suspect rather that
you have only done what you customarily do. I cannot truly comprehend what
drives others to break their bounds, since I never had them. People remain
surprisingly passive when faced with the prospect of death. Fear of public
ridicule or losing one’s livelihood is more likely to drive men to extremes and
the breaking of their customary habits. (79.55%)


> The two most important things I have to tell you are this. First, son, I have
every confidence in your ability to stay on the Light Side of the Force so long
as you choose to, and I have every confidence that you will choose to. (79.74%)


> Children grow up. I won’t lie to you and say that you will feel as close to us
at 20 as you do now. But your Mum and I will feel just as close to you when we
are old and grey and bothering the nursing-home robots. Children always grow up
and away from their parents, and the parents always follow them from behind,
offering helpful advice. Children grow up, and their personalities change, and
they do things that their parents wish they would not do, and they act
disrespectfully toward their parents and have them hauled out of their magical
schools, and the parents go on loving them anyway. It is Nature’s way. (79.80%)


> For Albus Dumbledore, as for her, the rule in extremis was to decide what was
the right thing to do, and do it no matter the cost to yourself. Even if it
meant breaking your bounds, or changing your role, or letting go of your
picture of yourself. That was the last resort of Gryffindor. (79.91%)


> “Only a man exceedingly proud and vain,” Dumbledore said quietly, as he turned
back to the Floo roaring up again with green flames, “would believe that his
heir should be like himself, rather than like who he wished that he could be.”
(80.64%)


> ...the term in the literature for this is ‘egocentric bias’, it means that you
experience everything about your own life but you don’t get to experience
everything else that happens in the world. There was way, way more going on
than you running in front of me. You’re going to spend weeks remembering that
thing you did there for six seconds, I can tell, but nobody else is going to
bother thinking about it. Other people spend a lot less time thinking about
your past mistakes than you do, just because you’re not the center of their
worlds. (80.64%)


> It is only by harsh experience that we learn which principles take priority
over which other principles; as mere words they all sound equally persuasive.
(89.18%)


> “Ruminating about the past can contribute to depression. You have my blanket
permisson to just never think about your past, ever. You shouldn’t think that
it’s your responsibility to Lily to bear your guilt for her, or anything like
that. Just keep your mind on your future and whatever new people you meet.”
(98.08%)


> It wasn’t what Harry usually thought about when he gazed at the stars, but from
a truly adult perspective, the stars were enormous heaps of valuable raw
materials that had unfortunately caught fire and needed to be scattered and put
out. If you were tapping the huge hydrogen-helium reservoirs for raw materials,
that meant your species had successfully grown up. (98.25%)


> There was a huge gap between who Harry needed to become, and who he was right
now. (98.42%)


> Harry kept his lips pressed shut. Letting people make their own decisions was
hard, because it meant they were allowed to make the wrong ones, but it still
had to be done. (99.18%)
