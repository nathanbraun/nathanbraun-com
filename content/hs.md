# Notes for HS Talk

## The problem with advice
- depends on the person, their goals and situation
- really good advice that applies to almost everyone (e.g. don't try heroin) is
  mostly well known 

So I can talk about my experience, what's worked for me and what I wish I'd
done differently or known when I was in HS, but your mileage may vary.

Will start with quick overview on my background then we can branch out to
whatever you guys think would be most helpful.

## My experience
- Neenah HS, 2005; UW Madison 2009, Montana State 2011
- environmental economics/BP Oil Spill
- learning to code/side projects
- data science day jobs
- working for myself teaching programming and data science with sports

## What would be useful?

Happy to expand on any of these, or anything else.

- What do programmers mostly do?
- How did I teach myself to code?
- What programming language should you learn?
- What's the connection between Java/programming in HS and businesses/what
  programmers do day to day?
  - e.g. how are lists, bools, arrays, objects useful?
- What's a CS degree like?
- What is data science?
- What kind of math do you use in programming?
- What I like about programming:
  - it's fun; like working on puzzles
  - it let's you build things -- app, website, analysis -- which is satisfying
  - it's everywhere
  - might be the field that cares the least about formal credentials
  - very powerful skillset
- What I like about entrepreneurship:
  - very minimal BS and wasted time
  - in theory, doesn't have to be a connection between time and results
  - easy to see how you're doing
  - requires a variety of skills
- General life advice
- Mistakes and misconceptions
- Tools I'm happy I learned/wish I learned earlier
  - Vim - type faster
  - Anki - memorize anything
