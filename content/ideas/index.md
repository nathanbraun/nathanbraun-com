# Ideas

I really like Kevin Lynagh's [list of open
ideas](https://kevinlynagh.com/ideas/), and in that spirit it might be useful
to list a few of my own. Kevin says it best:

Please let know me if:

- you'd be interested in using/testing any these
- you know of an existing solution to any of these
- you have suggestions/pointers about a relevant technique/approach
- you'd be interested in collaborating

Always happy to talk â€” [nate@nathanbraun.com](mailto:nate@nathanbraun.com).

### Speech to Text Book Notes
I read a lot and want to remember (and synthesize) what I've read/incorporate
it into my personal notes. [More on ways I've tried to do
this](ideas/voice-book-notes).

Basically, while reading a book on my Kindle, I want a low friction way to
take short, speech to text audio notes that are tied back to my book and
location. When I'm done, I want to be able to export all these to plain text
to deal with later.  These are just reminders, so high fidelity isn't
critical.

### Subset of Beeminder for digital distraction
[Beeminder](https://beeminder.com) is a tool that helps you achieve your goals
by charging you an ever-increasing amount money when you don't. It's very
effective for certain types of people, with many calling it life changing,
etc.

I've used Beeminder and mostly like it, but have a [few
issues](ideas/beeminder) (some with Beeminder, one with human nature) that
make me think the following could be a good idea.

A Beeminder type like service that:
- only looks at digital distraction type goals (limited time on Instagram, not using phone after 7 pm)
- costs a flat monthly fee
- donates all punishment dollars to charity

In theory, Beeminder can already do this (among other things), it just costs
$40 a month + keeps half of any penalties you pay.

### Combination vimwiki and vim-journal plugins
I'm a big fan of both [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) and
[vim-journal](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-journal). The former is a great
wiki/note taking system for Vim. The latter is a plugin by
[junegunn](https://github.com/junegunn) that mainly changes colors based on
indentation level, folds at the list level and has a few other minor syntax
things. I would pay (and have offered on reddit, fiverr and upwork) someone
hundreds of dollars to make this. Barring that, I'm seriously considering
learning vimscript to do it myself.
