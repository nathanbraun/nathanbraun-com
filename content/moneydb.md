This is from an [interview Elon Musk did with Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxREm3s1scA) in 2021. Elon has said
something like this a few times. Predictably, he gets crap for it.

> "Billionaire Elon Musk calls money 'Just an entry in a database' as fortune
  continues to soar." - [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/space/musk-tesla-founder-spacex-money-b1768311.html)

## What this means
When Elon says, "money just an entry in a database" he's not saying it in the
way people say "age is just a number" or that if he logs into his Chase
checking account and sees a $142B balance that that number is in some database
on Chase's servers (though it is).

Instead, what I think means is that anytime you buy or sell something (steal or
give), what you're really trading is *resources* (including your own labor).
Money (really prices) is information on these resources relative worth.

So right now in February 2023, the idea of money as information allows me to
say one bushel of wheat ($8.61) is worth 2.7 gallons of gas (at $3.15 per
gallon), or 29 minutes of an Amazon warehouse employees time (at $17.84 per
hour).

These are the ratios of exchange between goods and services that Elon is talking
about.

And like Musk says, that's necessary to move value across time and space.

### Time
If I grow some tomatoes, those are ripe, juicy resources, ready to consume now.
They're not going to last forever. But I can "sell" them to you, i.e. trade for
money. 

How does the money paid for tomatoes relate to value?

One answer is the value of money >= tomatoes for me (since I sold them) and
money <= tomatoes for you (since you bought them).

But again, because money doesn't have any value in and of itself, we're really
comparing the resources we can buy with $5 to to the tomatoes.

### Space
Moving value across space is a pretty easy extension of value across time.

Unless I sell my tomatoes then literally standing in one spot (maybe waiting
for an ice cream?), any shift in value across time is also a shift across space.

### Database?
Although I think it's catchy, calling it a "database" is a bit misleading. It's
not a database in the sense that it's persistent. If you pay me $5 cash for a
carton of tomatoes cash there's no record of that anywhere. Musk's alternative
framing, that "money is information" is probably technically more accurate.

Also, the information we get is one particular facet of value, namely the
*marginal* value of the resource. They money DB doesn't let us compute e.g. the
total value of all the water on earth and compare that to the total value of
diamonds.

## The software behind the money database
Musk thinks of different monetary systems as sort of the "software" this
database runs on. The current, US government as money supply system (in
practice a lot banks/credit card companies running "COBOL in batch mode") works
pretty well.

Historically, one problem with government as money database is that, as Musk
says, "governments [dilute] the money supply as a pernicious form of taxation."
I.e. governments have political incentives to print money. This is because
people like government spending a lot more than they like paying taxes.

This is why people like Ron Paul advocate a gold standard. The argument is this
would make it a lot harder for governments to dilute the money supply for
political reasons.

Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is another alternative. But it has drawbacks too,
probably ones more serious than the risk of government dilation. As Musk says:

> There is a fundamental issue with Bitcoin in its current form in that it's
> transaction volume is very limited. The latency for a properly confirmed
> transaction is too long. Much longer than you'd like. So it's not great for a
> transaction volume standpoint or a latency standpoint. So it is perhaps
> useful to solve an aspect of the money database problem, which is a store of
> wealth or an accounting of relative obligations, but it is not useful as a
> currency.
