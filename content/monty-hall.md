# A Simple Explanation of the Monty Hall Problem
## Background
Monty Hall, a gameshow host, presents to you three closed doors. Behind one is
a car, behind the other two are nothing (I think the original formulation says
they're goats — either way, not something you want).

You pick one of the doors.

No matter which you pick, Monty (who knows what's behind all the doors) opens
an empty door, and offers to let you *switch* your guess to the other,
remaining closed door if you would like.

Should you switch? Does it matter?

## Solution
Here's the clearest way I've found to think about it.

## Strategy #1: Don't Switch
Say you go in determined not to switch. No matter what, you won't switch.

Then if you happen to guess right on your first guess, you get the prize.

*There's a 1/3 chance you win with this strategy.* Fine.

## Strategy #2: Always Switch
Now say you go into it saying you'll switch no matter what.

What happens? You pick a door, Monty opens another, empty door (no matter
which door you pick, there's always an empty door for Monty to open — he knows
ahead of time what's behind them all). You switch to the other one.

What happens?

Well, if you guessed one of the two empty doors originally (it doesn't matter
which one), Monty will open the other empty door, and you'll switch to the
prize.

Since originally two out of the three doors are empty, *you have a 2/3 of
winning if you go into it planning on switching.*

The only way you *don't* win is if you pick the prize door originally, then
Monty opens an empty door, you switch away to the *other* empty door and walk
away with nothing (or a goat).  There's a 1/3 this happens.
