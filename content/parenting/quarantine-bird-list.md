# Quarantine Backyard Bird List

When the daycare first closed back in March 2020 my (then) three year old and I
decided to start a list of all the birds we saw in our yard during quarantine.
We were in the middle of Spring migration and I figured it'd be interesting to
keep track of what we saw over the next month or so.

...

Almost one year later and the kids are about ready to go back to daycare, which
means it might finally be time to call it a wrap on the list.

Here's what we got:

Of all of these, I think most interesting might be the Nashville Warbler, which
I never would have been able to identify had it not unfortunately hit one of
our windows.

The Rose Breasted Grosbeak were also interesting and easily identifiable. They
came through on a migration and stayed exactly one day.

All in all, I'd say the kids were moderately interested. Penelope can recognize
probably half the birds on here, and likes to take a look through the
binoculars at one every now and then.
