# Teaching Little Kids About Randomness
The other day my 4 year old and I had to decide something and got on the
subject of flipping coins. I thought it could be a good opportunity to learn
about randomness, so we invented the following "game".

## How You Play
1. Find a quarter (not necessarily easy in our cashless society!).
2. Everybody writes down their guess, heads or tails.
3. The kid flips the quarter.
4. Record the results.
5. Do steps (2) and (3) 10 times.
6. Tally the results, both who guessed the most correctly as well as the
   overall number of heads and tails.

## Notes
Yeah, this "game" is 100% luck, but most little kid games are (war anyone?). 

The benefit of doing 10 flips and recording them (as opposed to just flipping
a coin a bunch of times) is it let us see the breakdown of heads and tails at
the end, along with the order, both of which help give a more intuitive feel
for randomness.

I thought about leaving it at that, just flipping the coin 10 times and
recording the results, but I think writing down everyone's guess before each
flip helped my daughter stay engaged. And she definitely was engaged, she
remembered everyone's guesses every time and called out who was right and
wrong even before the coin stopped spinning.

We've done it just the one time so far, but we'll keep track of the results if
we do it again. Enough times and she might have a good grasp of the central
limit theorem before she's 5.

Our results. P is my 4 year old, (D)ad is me. (G)randpa and A (her two year
old brother, who guessed but did not get what was going on and also scribbled
on the sheet) also played. Can see P is the best guesser!
