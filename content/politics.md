# The Three Languages of Politics
One of the simplest, most illuminating books I've ever read is Arnold Kling's
The Three Languages of Politics.

Kling's idea: conservatives, liberals and libertarians *talk* about political
issues in terms of three, separate axes:
- progressives tend to view issues on the **oppressed** vs the **oppressor** axis
- conservatives view issues on the **civilization** vs **barbarism** axis
- libertarians view issues in terms of **freedom** vs **coercion**

- once you notice this framework, it becomes a lot easier to understand
  people's views on almost any issue

  - for example, illegal immigration:
    - progressives view immigrants as oppressed by unjust immigration laws.
      they're more likely to pay attention to kids in cages or stories of fully
      assimilated DREAMERs exceling in school at risk of being deported
    - conservatives argue that immigrants will have negative cultural impacts,
      i.e. that their civilization (western, market oriented, traditional values)
      might be in jeapordy. they also care a lot about the laws. they tend to
      focus on rates of criminality by immigrants (and specific examples), as
      well as immigrants advocating things like Sharia law
    - liberterians believe people should have the freedom be able to live, work
      and enter whatever mutually beneficial work arrangement they want, and
      laws prohibiting this. they'd pay more attention to stories of hardworking
      immigrations who came up from nothing (conservatives also appreciate this
      narrative) who are driving an Uber to earn money to send back to their
      families

- but often an issue (or fight about them) will be between two of the three
  camps
  - immigration is an issue where it's easy to see/understand all three sides.
    - many issues are like that
  - for example, columbus day:
    - progressives view Columbus as an invador, who oppressed/killed/cheated
      native american peoples
    - conservatives view columbus day as something america has *always*
      celebrated (e.g. the famous 18-- columbia exposition in chicago)
      - and, while not exactly denying that columbus did some bad things, was a
        sort of symbolic tipping point from barbarism to
        civilization/progress/literacy/america/industrial revolution etc
    - this particular issue doesn't seem to fit that well on the libertarian
      axis

  - or the recent california prop 22, which if passed would classify uber and
    lyft drivers as contractors (vs employees entitled to full benefits)
    - progressives view uber/lyft as oppressing drivers by classifying them as
      contract workers and not giving them health benefits
    - libertarians think drivers should have the freedom to driver for uber/lyft
      if they want, and do something else otherwise. the idea of government
      coercing uber/lyft into classifying drivers as full employees is abhorent

  - doesn't seem like conservatives have much of a horse here
    - might be different if uber/lyft weren't so new and instead the law was
      about using gov coercian to preserve coal mining or lobster fishing or
      something

- not all axis always equal
  - e.g. civil rights in US in 1960s historically has been viewed on the
    oppressor-oppressed dimension
    - though at the time a lot of people definitely argued individual
      businesses and people should have the *freedom* to discriminate if they
      want to
      - some still argue this today, but have to be pretty hardcore on the
        freedom-coercian axis
  - but most people in US today prob view the issue through that lens, and take
    a favorable view of civil rights, etc
  - another example: most people prob view the stuff going on in france
    (charlie hebdo, murder of a teacher, killing in churches) through the
    civilization-barbarism axis

# other points
- open question: how much do establishment politicians (and their orgs) really
  believe this?
  - vs picking conciously picking out and exploiting arguments from an axis
  - kling is careful to say's talking about communication (vs thinking)
    - why the book is called the three *languages* of politics
    - but i don't think that goes for enough for most people
  - i think it depends
    - i think most voters tend to actually think in terms of their preferred axis
    - actual politicians much less so
      - exceptions
        - maybe bernie sanders
        - i think someone like justin amash genuenly views issues in terms of the
          freedom-coercian axis
          - might just be my freedom-coercian bias talking
          - but at the same time, that stand has made him unpopular and in two mo
            he will no longer be a politician

- what does "thinking" (vs communicating) in our preferred axis mean?
  - who you pay attention to
    - immigration examples:
      - conservatives: immigrant criminals
      - progressives: kids in cages
      - libertarians: guy driving Uber for 80 hours a week
    - extends to other end of axis too:
      - conservatives pay a lot of attention to barbarians (tent cities!),
      - libertarians, examples of gov coercian (can't open a hair salon without
        an onerous license!)
      - progressives the oppressed (workers getting screwed by corporations,
        minorities getting screwed by police)
  - how you feel about the good/bad parts of the other axis
    - whether you even agree the good (freedom, civ, non-oppression) parts are
      good and the bad (corecian, barbarism, oppression) are bad
      - progressives might not care that much about
        - civilization
          - can see with environmental movement
        - coercian
          - e.g. socialism/communism
      - conservatives might not care that much about
        - oppression
          - who cares if you read a drug dealer his rights
          - collateral damage from drone strikes part of the deal when faced
            with people intent on destroying your civilization
        - liberty
          - patriot act
          - free trade
      - libertarians might not care about
        - civilization
          - immigrants should be let in on principle, even if it puts some of
            the freedom/market oriented aspects of modern civilization at ris
        - oppression
          - yeah sweat shops prob suck, but tech workers have a choice
  - the relative weight you give issue
    - for example, as someone who views most issues through the freedom-coercian
      axis, i don't deny that genuine oppression exists, but i definitely don't
      think it happens as frequently as someone like bernie sanders thinks

- is todays left hyper focused on oppression (particularly re: various minority
  identities, e.g. racial, trans) almost allergy-like?
  - someone makes the argument that as society progresses on real problems
    people need to fight about more and more minor stuff

- caplan's simplistic view of left and right
