# The Three Languages of Politics
One of the simplest, most illuminating books I've ever read is Arnold Kling's
[The Three Languages of Politics](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Languages-Politics-Talking-Political-dp-1948647427/dp/1948647427/ref=dp_ob_title_bk).

Kling's idea: conservatives, liberals and libertarians *communicate* (more on
whether it's just communicate or something more later) about political issues
on three, separate axes:
- progressives on the *oppressed* vs *oppressor* axis
- conservatives on the *civilization* vs *barbarism* axis
- libertarians in terms of *freedom* vs *coercion*

Once you notice this framework, it becomes a lot easier to understand other's
views on almost any issue.

Many issues span all three axes. Illegal immigration is a classic example:

## Illegal Immigration
### Progressives
Progressives view immigrants as oppressed by unjust immigration laws, border
patrol agents, ICE, etc. They're more likely to pay attention to kids in cages
or stories about fully assimilated DREAMERs excelling in school at risk of
being deported.

### Conservatives
Conservatives argue that immigrants (particularly illegal, but legal too) have
negative cultural impacts on "civilization" (western/market
oriented/traditional values) at the margin.

They also tend to focus on the fact that (by definition) illegal immigration is
against the law. They often focus on rates of criminality by immigrants (and
specific anecdotes), as well as anecdotes about immigrants advocating things
like Sharia law.

### Libertarians
Libertarians believe people should have the freedom be able to live, work and
enter whatever mutually beneficial work arrangement they want. They are against
immigration laws that prohibit this.

They'd pay more attention to stories of hardworking immigrations who came up
from nothing (conservatives also appreciate this narrative) who are driving an
Uber to earn money to send back to their families.

## Other Examples
Other examples of issues that pretty clearly span all three axes (see if you
can mentally make the argument for each axis):

- drug laws
- abortion
- soda taxes
- whether wedding cake bakers can discriminate against gay couples

(The last two come directly from Kling's book).

If I were a middle or high school civics teacher, I'd make students analyze
issues in terms of the axes all day long.

## Some issues are fights between two axes
Many issues have three distinct axes based arguments. But often an issue (or
a fight about them) will be between two of the three camps. Take Columbus day.

## Columbus day
### Progressives
Progressives view Columbus as an invader, who oppressed, killed and cheated
native American peoples.

### Conservatives
Conservatives view Columbus day as something America has *always*
[celebrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition) and
— while not exactly denying that Columbus did some bad things — was a sort of
symbolic tipping point to modern America, civilization, progress, etc.

### Libertarians
This particular issue doesn't seem to fit that well on the libertarian axis.
Maybe libertarians are against state holidays generally?

## Axes aren't always equal
On some issues, a dominant axis may emerge, where most people find themselves
on a certain axis, even if they don't usually frame issues this way.

For example, most people today view 1960s civil rights struggle in US on the
oppressor-oppressed dimension. This clearly wasn't the case at the time; many
people then thought individual businesses and people should have the *freedom*
to discriminate if they want.

While some people still advocate this, they're pretty hardcore on the
freedom-coercion axis. Most people in US today view the issue through that
lens, and take a favorable view of civil rights.

Other examples: initially, I think most people viewed both 9/11 and the
Charlie Hebdo shootings in civilization-barbarism terms (though apparently
many on the left have recently been accusing Charlie Hebdo of
[racism](https://nyti.ms/3rb1uc), so maybe this isn't a slam dunk).

# Extensions and Open Questions
Having though about the three axis model for a while and gotten in the habit
of viewing contentious issues through the various lenses, here are some
miscellaneous thoughts and open questions.

## 1. It's not that people are just on different axes, they often take issue with the (supposedly) good ends of other axes too
Each axis has its good end, i.e. freedom, civilization, non-oppression (OK
fine, it's debatable whether the progressive axis has a "good" end or whether
they're just anti-oppression).

To me, it seems like thinking primarily on an axis means you tend to discount
whether the good end of the other axes are worth pursuing. I think helps
explain certain behavior, and makes the model even more useful.

For example, progressives might just not care that much about:
- **civilization** — Especially obvious with the environmental movement and romanticized views on pre-colonial, indigenous societies. Also see how happy many progressives were happy about Covid lockdowns reducing carbon emissions.
- **freedom** — obvious historical examples of communism, socialism etc.  Though in general at the margin, are progressives *more* in favor of people being free to spend their money/hire who they want, or less?

Meanwhile *conservatives* don't care that much about:
- **oppression** — I think conservatives likely take issue with much that is categorized as oppression today. For example, conservatives are fond of pointing out that when you control for violent crime rates, it doesn't appear minorities are systematically more likely to be shot by police than whites.
- **freedom** — e.g. patriot act, Snowden as traitor

And *libertarians* don't care about:
- **oppression** — Likely similar views on oppression as conservatives (though in that specific example libertarians would say police in general are way too militarized and powerful). More of a freedom bent, and are hesitant to call anything the result of voluntary transactions oppression. "yeah, working in a sweat shop would suck, but these workers technically have a choice"
- **civilization** — immigrants should be let in on principle, even if it puts some of the freedom/market aspects of western culture at risk

## 2. Is this just the way people communicate, or is it something more?
Kling is careful to say he's talking about *communicating* about political
issues. That's why the book is called the three *languages* of politics.

> "Let me quickly add that I do *not* believe that the three-axes model serves
> to explain or describe the different political ideologies. I am not trying to

> saying that people think exclusively in terms of their preferred axis.

I'm not sure that goes far enough, though it's obviously noisy. But I would
expect, for example, that people who identify with the freedom-coercion axis
generally favor smaller government, fewer regulations etc.

## 3. How much do these axes bleed into each other?
When you stare at them for a while, the axes tend to blend together.
- *oppression* is arguably another word for infringing on someones *liberty*
- many progressives frame their oppression arguments in terms of "positive liberty", e.g. if a sweatshop worker or a poor kid in the ghetto doesn't have good options, they're not technically free.
- one of the foundational concepts of western civilization is freedom (life, liberty, pursuit of happiness) and equality under the law

Ok, there's some overlap. What should we do about it?

Probably just not think about it too hard. It's a model, not necessarily
exactly the way the world works in granular detail.

## 4. Is there another axis?
In the second edition, Kling toyed with adding what he called a bobo/anti bobo
axis.

Bobo is an idea from the NYT columnist David Brooks, and (in my understanding)
is basically the cosmopolitan/elite/smug/believe science vs the
backlash/anti-smug/troll/the CDC originally said not to wear masks axis.

In particular, the phenomena of Trump, who — while he definitely has
conservative themes like law and order, isn't exactly the epitome of western
civilization either — makes this axis intriguing.

## 5. On average, are members of some groups at more "extreme" ends of their axis than others?

Here I'm mostly thinking of progressives, which seems to have taken the
oppression/non-oppression axis so far in one direction (particularly when it
comes to racial, sexual and gender identities) that it seems almost
allergy-like.

(Allergies are caused by your body's immune system reacting too strongly to
things that are really not that big of a deal. In the same way, the left's
hyper sensitivity to any sort of identity-based oppression is causing some
real dysfunction).

# Other Loose Ends
- How does this theory fit with with Bryan Caplan's [simplistic view of left and right](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/10/my_simplistic_t.html) (the theory: the left hates markets, the right hates the left)?
- Many of the ideological fault lines seem to be about nature vs nurture. How does that fit in? Is it mostly relevant in shaping views on the extent of true oppression?
- Where do conspiracy theories fit? Are certain groups (OK, conservatives) more inclined to buy into conspiracy theories? If so, why?
- What about "elites"/believe science narrative? Where does this fit?
- Do people's cobbled-together, irrational, self-justifying minds make thinking about axes less useful? E.g. see the GOP House Freedom Caucus, which starting in 2016 did a massive shift away from Freedom/towards Trumpism. The three axes model doesn't seem to explain this well.
