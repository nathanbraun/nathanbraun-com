# The Three Languages of Politics
One of the simplest, most illuminating books I've ever read is Arnold Kling's
The Three Languages of Politics.

Kling's idea: conservatives, liberals and libertarians *talk* about political
issues in terms of three, separate axes:
- liberals tend to view issues on the **oppressed** vs the **oppressor** axis
- conservatives view issues on the **civilization** vs **barbarism** axis
- libertarians view issues in terms of **freedom** vs **coercion**

Kling wrote this book in 2013 (pre Trump), and last I heard was toying with a
axes (cultured/elite vs ...not) to represent him and his followers, but I'm not
positive where he's landed on that. I prefer the classic, three axes version
myself.
