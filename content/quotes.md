> "Markets, property rights, and trade provide a very powerful set of tools
  for coordinating the activities of a multitude of individual actors. But
  their functioning requires some way of defining property rights so that most
  of the effect of my actions is born by me, my property, and some reasonably
  small and identifiable set of other people.

> "If there is no way of defining property rights that meets that requirement,
  we have a problem. *The alternative institutions — courts, tort law,
  government regulation, intergovernmental negotiations ... work very poorly*.
  The more dispersed the effects, the worse they work.
  
> "If technological changes result in making actions with such dispersed
  effects play a much larger role in our lives ...  we have a problem for
  which no known institutions provide a reasonably good solution."

> "A pressure wave that moves the eardrum by less than the width of an atom
  will activate the ossicles and reach the brain as sound. You genuinely
  cannot improve upon that. As the acoustics scientist Mike Goldsmith has put
  it, “If we could hear quieter sounds still, we would live in a world of
  continuous noise, because the omnipresent random motion of air molecules
  would be audible. Our hearing really could not get any better.”"

\- *Bill Bryson, The Body*
