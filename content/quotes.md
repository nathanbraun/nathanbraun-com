> "Markets, property rights, and trade provide a very powerful set of tools for
coordinating the activities of a multitude of individual actors. But their
functioning requires some way of defining property rights so that most of the
effect of my actions is born by me, my property, and some reasonably small and
identifiable set of other people.

> "If there is no way of defining property rights that meets that requirement, we
have a problem. *The alternative institutions — courts, tort law, government
regulation, intergovernmental negotiations ... work very poorly*.  The more
dispersed the effects, the worse they work.

> "If technological changes result in making actions with such dispersed effects
play a much larger role in our lives ...  we have a problem for which no known
institutions provide a reasonably good solution."
> 
> \- *David Friedman, Future Imperfect*

rocket fuel."

> "In economic terms, inputs and labor “want” to be more productive, to find
> higher-valued uses. But in terms of actual agency that’s no more true than
> saying that giraffes “want” to have long necks. The active agent in
> biological evolution is natural selection; the active agent in economics is
> entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs relentlessly seeking profits search for
> resources that can be moved, transformed, or combined in ways that can be
> sold at a profit."
> 
> \- Michael Munger

---

> "Life colonized the energy gradients: plants put themselves between sun and
stone; animals put themselves between plants and decay. Criminals infiltrated

> 
> \- *Derek Künsken, The Quantum Magician*

---

> "Our universe might have slid into equilibrium emitting nothing more than a
> quiet hiss. The fact that it spawned such plentitude is a miracle..."
>
> \- *Ted Chiang, Exhalation*
