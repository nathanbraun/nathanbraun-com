# Vim For Everyone
Vim For Everyone — available at
[vimforeveryone.com](https://www.vimforeveryone.com) — is a site (it's in
progress) I put up early in 2021 to extol the benefits of Vim for non
programmers.

## What is Vim?
Vim is a really fast text editor. Most people use it to edit code, but it's
also great for maintaining your own personal knowledge base (wiki, notes to
yourself, etc), which is the use case I'm advocating on the site.

The main motivation to use Vim is speed. Going from hunting and pecking to
regular touch typing is big jump. Going from regular typing to Vim is
a similar jump in my experience.

I'll save the evangelizing for the site, but suffice to say if you're
interested in taking notes on, consuming and making connections between
information — and you like keyboard shortcuts — you should definitely check
Vim out.

## Motivation
I've been using Vim for about 10 years. Initially, it was for code, but within
a few months I found everything else too slow and frustrating and so was using
Vim to take and manage all my notes (on meetings, plan my days, etc).

I was inspired to create [Vim For Everyone](https://vimforeveryone.com) after
hearing a lot recently about other personal note taking tools — Roam, Notion,
Workflowy, Evernote etc. After it looking into them, it was quickly apparent
that (at least for me) they weren't going match the setup I had in Vim.

## Market Research
Out of curiosity, I poked around a bit to see if there was a thriving
community of non technical Vim users (like the [Roam
cult](https://tobiasbru.medium.com/the-history-of-roam-research-and-the-roamcult-4c1e1897633d)
but for Vim) and found... exactly one [reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/3wpour/is_vim_useful_to_nonprogrammers_or_is_it_only/)
from 2015 with 38 upvotes.

Hence the site. Vim isn't literally for everyone, but the non coder Vim space
is criminally underdeveloped.

## Goals
The purpose is more to get non-coders intrigued by Vim than to be necessarily
definitive source for learning how to use it. 

Part of the issue is I learned it ~10 years ago and haven't thought recently
about the quickest, easiest way to get it across. However, I will probably
write up some thoughts at some point.

## Bottom Line
Here's how useful the personal notes, non-coding part of Vim has been for me:
if I could get a handful of people to pick it up that would have never
otherwise heard of it, and they got about as much use of it as I do, I could
honestly see it being the most valuable thing I've done to date.
