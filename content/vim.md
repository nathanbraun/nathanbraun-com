# Vim For Everyone
Vim For Everyone — available at
[vimforeveryone.com](https://www.vimforeveryone.com) — is a site (it's in
progress) I put up early in 2021 to extol the benefits of Vim for non
programmers.

## What is Vim?
Vim is a really fast text editor. Most people use it to edit code, but it's
also great for maintaining your own personal knowledge base (wiki, notes to
yourself, etc), which is the use case I'm advocating.

Much more at the site, but the main motivation to use Vim is speed. Going from
hunting and pecking to regular touch typing is big jump. Going from regular
typing to Vim is similar just, in my opinion.

## Motivation
I've been using Vim for about 10 years. Initially, it was for code, but within
a few months couldn't handle typing in anything else (too slow) and was using
it to take and manage all my notes (notes on meetings, plan my days, etc).

I was inspired to create [Vim For Everyone](https://vimforeveryone.com) by
reading recently about other personal note taking tools — Roam, Notion,
Workflowy, Evernote etc. After it looking into them, it was quickly apparent
that (at least for me) they weren't going match the setup I had in Vim.

## Market Research
Out of curiosity, I poked around a bit to see if there was a thriving
community of non technical Vim users (the Vim equivalent of the Roam cult) and
found... exactly one [reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/3wpour/is_vim_useful_to_nonprogrammers_or_is_it_only/)
from 2015 with 38 upvotes.

Hence the site. Vim isn't literally for everyone, but the non coder Vim space
*is* criminally underdeveloped.

## Goals
The purpose is more to get non-coders intrigued by Vim than to be necessarily
definitive source for learning how to use it. 

Part of the issue is I personally learned it ~10 years ago and am not
necessarily up to date on the quickest, easiest way to get it across. However,
I will probably write up some thoughts at some point.

## Bottom Line
Here's how useful the non-coding parts of Vim have been for me: if I could get
a handful of people to pick it up that would have never otherwise heard of it,
and they got about as much use of it as I do, I could honestly see it being
the most valuable thing I've done to date.
